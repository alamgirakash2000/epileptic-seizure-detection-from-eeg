    "The original dataset from the reference consists of 5 different folders, each with 100 files, with each file representing a single subject/person. Each file is a recording of brain activity for 23.6 seconds. The corresponding time-series is sampled into 4097 data points. Each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time. So we have total 500 individuals with each has 4097 data points for 23.5 seconds\n",

    "We acquire publicly accessible EEG data from Bonn University, wherein the data include five sets(A,B,C,D and E). Each set consists of 100 single EEG segments with a sampling rate of 173.6 Hz. The EEG signals were filtered using a Bandpass filter and smoothing method. The first two sets (A,B) represent healthy people, whose signals were taken with open and closed eyes. The other three sets represent eliptic persons. Set (C, D) were treated as non-seizure because the signals are captured in duration without seizures. For seizure detection, set(E) was only treated as an eliptic seizure.\n",
